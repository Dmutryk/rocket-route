# rocket-route
After `git clone` don't forget to:
- run `composer install`
- run `php artisan key:generate` for generating app key
- create `.env` file from `.env.example` and fill credentials for rocket route and google maps

#### The google map you can see at the general page `/`

I'm not sure that everything is done as expected, especially testing, because of lack of time. If you want to see some other functionality or my ability - feel free to text me at `dmutrykv@gmail.com`
